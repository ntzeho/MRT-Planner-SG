<!-- # MRT Planner SG -->
MRT Planner SG is a web application that plans your MRT/LRT journeys for you! Enter your boarding and alighting stations, and all feasible routes, estimated travelling times as well as the latest timings you should be boarding your train will be displayed. As there are no public real-time data on train arrival times, knowing the latest possible time you should board your train to reach your destination will be useful in planning a late night out with friends/family!
